# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview

**Sandwich Club** app shows a list of sandwiches. When a sandwich is selected a more detailed description is displayed. The app layout is populated from data received as JSON.

The app is part of the Udacity course: **Android Developer Nanodegree Program**.


## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project helps to better understand how it is processed.


## Project requirements
- JSON data is parsed correctly to a Sandwich object in JsonUtils
- JSON is parsed without using 3rd party libraries
- DetailActivity shows all Sandwich details correctly
- Detail layout includes a ScrollView so all the details are visible in small screen devices
- Sandwich details are shown in a sensible layout. For example, ingredients appear next to the ingredients label
